# Assignment3_java

This repository contains three modular Java applications demonstrating core object-oriented programming concepts through practical simulations.

## 🚗 Vehicle System
Simulates a vehicle hierarchy using:
- Abstract class `Vehicle`
- Subclasses `Car` and `Bike`
- Interface `FuelEfficient`
- Demonstrates method overriding and runtime polymorphism

## 🎓 College Portal
Models a basic academic portal with:
- Classes for `Student`, `Faculty`, `Course`, and `Admin`
- Role-based access and dynamic enrollment
- Encapsulated logic and modular design

## 🛒 Online Marketplace
Implements an e-commerce simulation:
- Classes for `Product`, `User`, `Buyer`, `Seller`, `Order`, and `Cart`
- Cart management, order placement, and stock validation
- Inheritance and role-specific behaviors

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Interface Implementation

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
javac *.java
java Main
